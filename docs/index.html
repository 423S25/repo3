            <h2>About the Product</h2>
            <p>This project is a user-friendly, centralized resource and document hub developed for HRDC.
                 Built using Plone, the site serves as an efficient platform for storing and sharing a wide range of documents and resources, 
                 including important files, links to external sites, and other essential information for the nonprofitâ€™s operations. 
                 By using Plone we can ensure that HRDC has the ability to maintain and update the site without the need of additional overhead, 
                 or relying on external developers.</p>
